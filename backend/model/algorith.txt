// install service procedure
- we need a variable to store a file(it contain queries to create tables)
   - the name is queryfile = --dirName() + ''
- we call a method to read the file asynchronously
   - the method name is readFileSync(filename,'utf-8');
- now we need a variable that store the wuery of a single table and leave the rest
   - first it see if there is a comment if there is we pass
   - second it looks the end of the query by using  comma.
   - then push each query to a variable of an array.

- finally by using forEach() method it executes each query found in the  array.
